# EverAfter

an application to chronicle the history of a relationship

## Description

EverAfter is an application to chronicle the history of a relationship, from the first meeting to the wedding and beyond. Users will be able to add photos and captions to tell the world about their journey, or keep it private between just them and their special someone.

This would be the perfect website to share a couple's backstory with wedding guests, or to reminisce while on a coach during a cozy night.

## Introduction

I was looking for a way to share our personal relationship journey with my partner in a way that included notes and pictures, but wasn't a boring slidedeck. I was inspired to create this application just for us, but began to think of the fun others might have in using this application.

## Problem

I wanted to have an application that allowed a user to share pictures and backstory with one or more other people, to express the love that the user feels for their partner in a dynamic visual medium.

## Solution

EverAfter will be a horizontal timeline application the starts with a user chosen date and ends with at an indefinite point in time. The user will upload pictures in a carousel above the timeline and caption those pictures with anecdotes and background information below the timeline. The user will be able to choose if the timeline is public or private, and can share the timeline and their story with whomever they choose.

See below for some screenshots of the application:
